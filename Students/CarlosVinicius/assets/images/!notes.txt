--------


player single cell size: (x: 15, y: 16)

animations are here:
 	//addAnimation(name, frames, fps, loop);
 	addAnimation("idle", [0], 0, false);
 	addAnimation("moveOnGround", [0, 1, 0, 2], 20, true);
 	addAnimation("wallTouch", [3, 4, 5], 50, false);
 	addAnimation("midair", [ 0, 6, 6, 7], 20, false);

Player_Genclops.png has an extra animation: addAnimation("shoot", [8], 0, false);


Player_Flame2.png has a glow image embeded to
it because glow was lagging behind in Flixel when seperated.
I included an embedded and vanilla versions depending on your game engine.
